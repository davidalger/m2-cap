This is a test configuration for use in development of the [capistrano-magento2](https://github.com/davidalger/capistrano-magento2/) gem. It requires that there be valid SSH config settings present for connections to the target servers in `single.rb` and `multi.rb` to function. Because this is a test repository meant to be run against transient targets, a working test `env.php` artifact is copied up (for the sake of simplicity) to the target via a special rake task in `lib/capistrano/tasks/artifacts.rake`.
